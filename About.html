                <strong>How I stay committed to learning</strong>
                
                <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner.
                I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using
                what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>

                <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what 
                I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>

                <strong>How I got started</strong>
                
                <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
                I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session,
                I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also 
                write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized
                that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
